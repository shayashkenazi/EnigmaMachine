# EnigmaMachine
enigmaMachine
This is a Java implementation of an Enigma machine, along with code that attempts to break the encryption. This code is associated with the Computerphile [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM) on cracking enigma.

An enigma machine is a mechanical encryption device that saw a lot of use before and during WW2.
 
Java implementation of the iconic Enigma machine, complete with a user-friendly JavaFX GUI.
It offers encryption and decryption functionalities, accompanied by a challenging code-breaking mechanism to assess its security.
Furthermore, the integration of a Tomcat server enhances its capabilities, enabling seamless client-server communication for practical applications and network interactions.

**More about the project** -
Realization of a battlefield competition, where the enemy forces (German submarines) transmitting ciphers using the Enigma machine are stationed on the one hand and the allied forces, deployed in different teams, are stationed on the other side, trying to intercept and decipher the transmissions. This competition will be realized through a server-client configuration and will include reliance on the graphical interface created alongside the lifting of several additional processes.

about the video - we see that we see the automatic decoding process of encrypted messages using "agents" while presenting the process as a graphical interface using JavaFx.
