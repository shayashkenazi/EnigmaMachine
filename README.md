# EnigmaMachine
enigmaMachine
This is a Java implementation of an Enigma machine, along with code that attempts to break the encryption. This code is associated with the Computerphile [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM) on cracking enigma.

An enigma machine is a mechanical encryption device that saw a lot of use before and during WW2.
 
Java implementation of the iconic Enigma machine, complete with a user-friendly JavaFX GUI.
It offers encryption and decryption functionalities, accompanied by a challenging code-breaking mechanism to assess its security.
Furthermore, the integration of a Tomcat server enhances its capabilities, enabling seamless client-server communication for practical applications and network interactions.
